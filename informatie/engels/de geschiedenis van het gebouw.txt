The Amsterdam Museum is located between Kalverstraat and Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal. The history of this place goes back to the Middle Ages, when the Sint-Lucienklooster was located here: a women's monastery with its own beer brewery and livestock. The stable stood approximately where the museum caf√© is now. In 1578 the city decided that the Burgerweeshuis should be built here. That orphanage, which usually housed hundreds of children, remained there for almost four centuries, until 1960. The Regentenkamer and the Orphans' boxes in the courtyard, for example, date from this period. The Amsterdam Museum has been located here since 1975, which at the time was opened under the name Amsterdams Historisch Museum.
